FADE IN:

INT. OFFICE

We see two developers, MILFORD and RADLEY, sitting at a desk looking at two 
computer monitors, working on a bug.

We see the back of the screens out to the office scape behind the developers' 
seats.

GALEN, a product manager suddenly appears from the right.

		           GALEN
        Hey guys, great work on that orgs page.  It's loading way faster than 
        before.


MILFORD and RADLEY turn to look at at GALEN.  RADLEY, being further from GALEN
sits back in his chair.


                MILFORD
        Thanks GALEN.  We worked a lot on --


                GALEN
        Yeah, yeah, but, you know, there's still something missing.


MILFORD looks a little surprised.  He was sure their work met the requirements
described on the ticket.  RADLEY's expression is unchanged.


                GALEN
        Do you have it up? I can show you real quick.


GALEN brushes MILFORD aside, grabs the mouse and gets a wicked gleam in his eye. 
He navigates to the accounts page, and is greeted by a WOCKA.

                MILFORD
        That's the bug we're working on, it's not related to-

                GALEN
        Right, right.

GALEN navigates to the account page for a different account, and once again sees
a WOCKA.  A tense silence ensues, broken eventually when

                RADLEY
        Maybe you should show us on DEV-VM?

A slighly confused expression crosses GALEN's face, and another tense silence fills
the air.  MILFORD expertly uses the keyboard to load up the accounts page.

                GALEN
        Did you see that?

                MILFORD
        See what?
