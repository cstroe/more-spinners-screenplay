This repo is great ... but ... you know what it needs? More spinners!

FADE IN:

INT. OFFICE

We see two developers, MILFORD and RADLEY, sitting at a desk looking at two 
computer monitors, working on a bug.

We see the back of the screens out to the office scape behind the developers' 
seats.

GALEN, a product manager suddenly appears from the right.

		GALEN
	Hey guys, great work on that orgs page.  It's loading way faster than 
        before.


MILFORD and RADLEY turn to look at at GALEN.  RADLEY, being further from GALEN
sits back in his chair.


                MILFORD
        Thanks GALEN.  We worked a lot on --


                GALEN
        Yeah, yeah, but, you know, there's still something missing.


MILFORD looks a little surprised.  He was sure their work met the requirements
described on the ticket.  RADLEY's expression is unchanged.


                GALEN
        Do you have it up? I can show you real quick.
